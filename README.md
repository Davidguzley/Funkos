## Description

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Funkos catalog system. The system allows admins to manage products and users, while anonymous users can browse and select items from the catalog. The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **project**: This directory contains the code for the Funkos catalog system. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

- **documentation**: This directory contains all the documentation and guidelines for working on the project. It provides information on the development process, coding standards, and best practices.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Bootstrap

## Future Actions

- Add a deployment manual for the project on Digital Ocean to deploy the project remotely.

## Usage
- Create a MongoDB database and obtain your `MongoDB URI` - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the `project` directory.

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)
